## Week 2 Project
This is my first attempt at a node.js MVC project.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
```bash
node app.js
```

## Todo
If this is a base for the rest of the class then I definitely need to make models, cause right now I'm not really following very good MVC practices.
Make everything look the same, add nice nav bars, actually spend some time on the css to make it pretty.

## License
Bootstrap is in here somewhere, I don't know if it's okay for me to put that in here or not, but it seems like it wouldn't be an issue.

All my code do whatever with I guess.
